Here’s a pseudocode solution for the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Power Allocation Algorithm for your power supply system:

 Problem Constraints Recap:
- The power supply system has a total capacity of 92 units.
- Each device has a maximum capacity of 40 units.
- We need to manage devices as they connect, disconnect, or change their power consumption based on FIFO order.

 Assumptions:
- FIFO rule: The first device to connect gets priority in power allocation.
- Power allocation: If a device wants more power than is available, it is allocated as much as can be given.
- When a device disconnects, its allocated power is freed up and can be reassigned to other devices in FIFO order.

 Pseudocode:

pseudo
class Device:
    string name
    int max_capacity
    int current_consumption
    int connection_time

class PowerAllocator:
    int total_capacity = 92
    int available_capacity = 92
    list devices = [] // List to store devices in FIFO order

    // Method to allocate power when a device connects
    function connect_device(device):
        if available_capacity == 0:
            print("Error: No available power.")
            return

        // Find how much power this device can consume
        allocated_power = min(device.max_capacity, available_capacity)
        device.current_consumption = allocated_power
        available_capacity -= allocated_power

        // Add the device to the FIFO list
        devices.append(device)
        print(f"Device {device.name} connected, allocated {allocated_power} units.")

    // Method to change the power consumption of a device
    function change_device_power(device, new_power):
        // Remove the old power consumption from available capacity
        available_capacity += device.current_consumption

        // Update the device power consumption
        device.current_consumption = new_power

        // Reallocate power if needed
        if new_power > device.current_consumption:
            allocate_extra_power()

    // Method to allocate remaining power if some is freed up
    function allocate_extra_power():
        for device in devices:
            if device.current_consumption < device.max_capacity and available_capacity > 0:
                # Calculate the power to be allocated to the device
                extra_power = min(device.max_capacity - device.current_consumption, available_capacity)
                device.current_consumption += extra_power
                available_capacity -= extra_power
                print(f"Device {device.name} allocated extra {extra_power} units.")

    // Method to handle when a device disconnects
    function disconnect_device(device):
        // Free up the device's current consumption power
        available_capacity += device.current_consumption
        devices.remove(device) // Remove device from FIFO list
        print(f"Device {device.name} disconnected, released {device.current_consumption} units.")

    // Method to print current status of power allocation
    function print_status():
        print("Current power allocation:")
        for device in devices:
            print(f"Device {device.name}: {device.current_consumption} units")

    // Main loop to handle events
    function process_event(event):
        switch event.type:
            case "connect":
                connect_device(event.device)
            case "change":
                change_device_power(event.device, event.new_power)
            case "disconnect":
                disconnect_device(event.device)
            case "status":
                print_status()

// Simulation
allocator = PowerAllocator()

// Example Events
event1 = {type: "connect", device: Device("A", 40, 0)}
event2 = {type: "connect", device: Device("B", 40, 0)}
event3 = {type: "connect", device: Device("C", 40, 0)}
event4 = {type: "change", device: Device("A", 20, 40), new_power: 20}
event5 = {type: "disconnect", device: Device("B", 40, 40)}

allocator.process_event(event1) // Device A connects
allocator.process_event(event2) // Device B connects
allocator.process_event(event3) // Device C connects
allocator.process_event(event4) // Device A changes power to 20
allocator.process_event(event5) // Device B disconnects


 Explanation:

1. Device Class: Defines each device with a name, maximum capacity, current consumption, and connection timestamp.
  
2. **PowerAllocator Class**:
   - connect_device(device): Allocates available power to a new device based on FIFO order and available capacity.
   - change_device_power(device, new_power): Updates the power consumption of an existing device and re-adjusts the allocation as needed.
   - allocate_extra_power(): If there’s extra available capacity, this method reallocates it to devices that are not using their full power.
   - disconnect_device(device): Frees up power when a device disconnects, making it available for other devices.
   - print_status(): Displays the current power allocation for each device.

3. Main Loop: Processes events based on their type: connect, change, or disconnect.
    The system adjusts available capacity and reallocates power as needed.

 Example Scenario Walkthrough:
1. t=0: Device A connects → Allocates 40 units.
2. t=1: Device B connects → Allocates 40 units (A keeps 40 units).
3. t=2: Device C connects → Allocates 12 units (remaining capacity is 12).
4. t=3: Device A drops to 20 units → Allocates 20 units (B keeps 40, C increases to 32 units).
5. t=4: Device B disconnects → Releases 40 units → C gets 40 units.

Summary:
This pseudocode covers the essential operations of a FIFO-based power allocation system. 
 It ensures that the devices are allocated power based on availability, priority, and consumption changes. 
 The system is flexible enough to handle dynamic power adjustments, disconnections, and capacity limitations 
 while ensuring that the total power usage does not exceed the system’s maximum allowed capacity.
