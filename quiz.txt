Power Allocation Algorithm
Ready for a unique challenge? We've prepared a special problem that combines algorithm design with real-world constraints. This is optional.
You manage a power supply system with a maximum capacity of 100 units, but for safety you can only use 92 units. Multiple devices can draw power simultaneously, with each device having a maximum capacity of 40 units.
Write pseudo code for a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) resource allocation system that handles these events:
- When a new device starts consuming power
- When a device stops consuming power
- When a device changes its consumption level

Example scenario:
t=0: Device A connects → gets 40 units (max capacity)
t=1: Device B connects → A keeps 40 units, B gets 40 units 
t=2: Device C connects → A keeps 40 units, B keeps 40 units, C gets 12 units (remaining available)
t=3: Device A drops to 20 units → A keeps 20 units (by choice), B keeps 40 units, C increases to 32 units
t=4: Device B disconnects → A keeps 20 units (by choice), C increases to 40 units, 32 units now available

Input: List of active devices with their connection timestamps and current consumption values
Output: Maximum allowed power for each active device
